## Introduction

The Netflix Churn Predictor is designed to help streaming platforms anticipate and mitigate user churn. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system provides personalized recommendations and predictive insights to improve user engagement and retention.

## Features

- **Forecasted Insights:** Predict user churn risks and implement strategic engagement tactics.
- **Customized Recommendations:** Offer tailored content suggestions based on user behavior.
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continuously adapt recommendations using real-time data.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive dashboards for clear visualizations and insights.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Inform users of significant updates and alerts.

## Architecture

The system is built on a microservices architecture deployed on a cloud-based platform, ensuring scalability and flexibility. Key components include:

- **Prediction Engine:** Microservices for data preprocessing, model training, and churn prediction.
- **Data Storage:** Uses Amazon DynamoDB for user data and Amazon S3 for model storage.
- **User Interface:** Web interface and mobile app for user interaction.
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for secure access.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) for timely alerts.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Amazon CloudWatch and CloudTrail for system health and event logging.

## Modules

1. **Netflix Churn Predictor System:** The core system for predicting churn.
2. **User Interface:** Web and mobile applications for user interaction.
3. **Data Storage:** Amazon DynamoDB and S3 for data and model storage.
4. **Prediction Engine:** Microservices for data preprocessing, model training, and predictions.
5. **External APIs:** Interfaces for external system interactions.
6. **Authentication and Authorization:** OAuth 2.0 and RBAC for secure access.
7. **Real-time Notifications:** Amazon SNS for user notifications.
8. **Monitoring and Logging:** Tools for system health and event logging.
9. **Deployment:** Managed via Amazon ECS or Kubernetes, AWS Amplify for web interface, and mobile app store deployments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Node.js
- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., sci-kit-learn, TensorFlow)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netflix-churn-predictor.git
    cd netflix-churn-predictor
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up AWS services:
    - Configure Amazon DynamoDB and S3
    - Deploy microservices using Amazon ECS or Kubernetes
    - Configure Amazon SNS for notifications

4. Deploy the web interface:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    aws s3 sync build/ s3://your-bucket-name
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Prediction Engine

1. Start the microservices:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

2. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Use the interface to input user data and receive churn predictions.

### Monitoring and Logging

- Use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring system health.
- Use Amazon CloudTrail for logging events and user actions.
